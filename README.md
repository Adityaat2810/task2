#proposed solution
‹#3›
We will (as a team) create an android application where students from different universities can sign up or
create their account using email and the password during signup must be of 8 characters (Minimum One
Caps character, Minimum One Special character and Minimum two numbers must be included). From next
time they can directly login through their registered gmail along with their password. We will have two
different login portal one for recruiters and one for student . Our app authenticate our users through their
email or mobile number and then they can access a folder or link associated to them where they can
upload their projects , college assignments and their college files. We personalized our app in that way
that the users have their projects in chronological order with date and time of uploading. We will also have
a technology that gives the reminder about submission of their assignment. We will also have a mandatory
portal during signup regarding user's stream.Recruiters can see public projects and give opportunity to
students according to their skills. According to that we will also push suggestions or carrier guidance to
our user that help them in future. This app also have social engagement features like such as comments ,
like and share the projects uploaded in public mode. This feature encourages our users to be more active.
We will also introduce chatting feature that helps our users in building their network with each other. We
will also introduce "STREAK" feature that helps us in user retention. We use "FIREBASE" database to store
data of all users safely and securely. We will also introduce different themes. We will also promise our
users that their "data privacy" is always our first concern. We will also push regular updates for securing
our user's data.
